This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, specifically on Android.  The issue is that `Dimensions.get('window')` might return `undefined` or incorrect dimensions, especially in situations where the layout hasn't fully finished rendering.  This leads to unexpected behavior, such as components being rendered off-screen or layout issues.

```javascript
// Incorrect Usage
const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');

// ... further code that uses width and height ...
```
